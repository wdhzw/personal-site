# Intro

I am currently a Master of Computing student at NUS.  

<br>
I received a full scholarship from the Ministry of Education (Singapore) and NUS in 2018. After that, I completed my bridging course at NUS in 2019 and earned my bachelor's degree with the highest distinction honors at NUS in 2023. I am interested in the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), Machine Learning, and Software Development.
