# Intro

I am a Master of Computing student at NUS, currently works at Mind Stretcher Education as a software engineer intern and help to make education better using tech, for example, AI.

<br>
I received a full scholarship from the Ministry of Education (Singapore) and NUS in 2018. After that, I completed my bridging course at NUS in 2019 and earned my bachelor's degree with the highest distinction honors at NUS in 2023. I am interested in the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), Machine Learning, and Software Development.
